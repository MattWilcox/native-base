				NOTE:
				Choices regarding how site navigation is marked-up can have implications on the performance of web projects once a CMS is involved.

				Site navigation may be editable by someone in the CMS. Ideally, site navigation and other chunks of mark-up that are identical between multiple pages should be generated only once by the CMS. This allows it to be generated once, cached once, and included on all other pages. This is a fast and efficient way to use server resources. However, things like an `aria-current="page"` applied in mark-up for the navigation mean that the navigation itself becomes unique per-page instead of identical over all pages, and what was a simple resource-light include must now be generated dynamically per page (and possibly cached per page).

				One method to try and get the best of both worlds is to use JS so that the client's browser adds the `aria-current="page"` to the correct element, instead of the server needing to do this. It does mean that an accessibility enhancement becomes reliant on JS being enabled, but this is one of those choices that need to be considered per project.

			<h2 class="uc_h2">Context</h2>
			<p>Native Base is a pure HTML/CSS/JS example repository for 2023, aiming for best-practice patterns and to be used as a starting place upon which to build other projects. View the source code. <a href="https://github.com/MattWilcox/native-base">Learn more about this project's goals on GitHub</a>.</p>

		<article class="uc_rich-text">
			<h2 class="uc_h2">Code style</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Tabs for indentation</li>
				<li>Spaces for alignment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tabs should be used for indentation, because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Screen reader technology such as <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/7475#issuecomment-668544890">Braille displays handle tabbed indentation better than spaces used for indentation</a>.</li>
				<li>Tab width is configurable by the person looking at the code, who may have <a href="https://adamtuttle.codes/blog/2021/tabs-vs-spaces-its-an-accessibility-issue/">vision issues</a>. If they prefer a tab to be 2, or 4, or 8 spaces wide they can set that in their editor. Just as they can set line heights. So can you.</li>
				<li>Using tabs is being respectful of other people. It does not stop your own editor from displaying exactly how you want it, and it allows others to have it how they want it.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I'm pretty strict about my indentation, because I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_folding">code-folding</a> heavily. Code folding allows me to collapse sections of code that are not relevant to the current task, which removes them from my mind so I can concentrate on what I'm working on without visual clutter.</p>

		<article class="uc_rich-text">
			<h2 class="uc_h2">Code comments</h2>
			<p>I try to comment liberally.</p>
			<p>When a server sends HTML it should be configured to minify and compress the mark-up, which removes HTML comments too. Code comments have no impact on the end product, and liberally using them will help others - and yourself - understand what you were thinking, referencing, and doing at the time you wrote the code.</p>
			<p>If you're working in a templating language, it may make sense to use the template languages comments rather than HTML's more verbose comment syntax.</p>
